#SignWave
As an elderly bedridden patient, its hard to keep track of everything. Nurses and doctors make lives easier. To help out, we made an app that uses [Myo](https://www.thalmic.com/en/myo/) gestures and allows patients to notify the nurses and/or doctor via [twilio](http://twilio.com).


Logo made from [Hipster Logo Generator](http://www.hipsterlogogenerator.com) and scored a 5 out of 5 on the hipstometer. Yes, we did drop that much swag.
