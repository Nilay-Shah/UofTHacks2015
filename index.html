		<p> We decided to create a pseudo-sign language for patients in hospitals who have difficulty communicating (including the elderly people).
We used the Myo-Arm band to detect the patient's arm gestures and relay information to the medical staff.
A Twilio message is automatically sent to a monitor in case the doctor is close by and also via text or call depending on the urgency of the situation.
We also used text-to-speech synthesizing software so the doctor will receive messages while being on their computer without pulling out their phones. </p>
